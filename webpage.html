    <p style="text-align: center;">Hi there !!! <br>My name is Ovin Nawarathne, Im currently 22 years old as of creating
        this simple webpage for testing
        and am so excited to learn about Cloud Native Application Development! While I am quite familiar with HTML, CSS,
        a little bit of JS and
        the use of Bootstrap, I have yet to fully understand JS. The learning course provided by linkedIn helped alot,
        but as they say,
        "Practise makes perfect", so I will continue to Practise the use of JS. I won't take too much of your time to
        look at this
        intro, hope you have an Awsome day! </p>
